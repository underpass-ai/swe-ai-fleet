## 🎓 Lessons Learned & Memorized

### [[memory:9733758]] Never Mock in Production
Production servers should return `UNIMPLEMENTED`, not fake functionality with mocks.

### [[memory:9733760]] Generate APIs During Build
Generate protobuf files during container build, not commit to git. Use BuildKit cache mounts.

### [[memory:9733761]] Self-Contained Tests
Integration tests should run in containers without local Python dependencies.

### [[memory:9734055]] Pre-Implementation Questions
Before creating microservices, answer: who calls it, how, public/private, dependencies, data needs.

### [[memory:9734181]] Context-First API Design ⭐ NEW
**NEVER design APIs before understanding full context.** Map interactions and use cases FIRST, then design API.

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Cluster Information
```
Namespace: swe-ai-fleet
Service: orchestrator (ClusterIP)
Image: registry.underpassai.com/swe-fleet/orchestrator:v0.2.0
Pods: 2/2 Running
Status: ✅ Healthy
```

### Access Points
```
Internal (cluster):
  orchestrator:50055
  orchestrator.swe-ai-fleet.svc.cluster.local:50055

External:
  ❌ Not exposed (private backend service)
  
Access via:
  ✅ Gateway service
  ✅ Other microservices
  ✅ NATS consumers
```

### Health Check
```bash
kubectl logs -n swe-ai-fleet -l app=orchestrator --tail=5

Output:
✅ Orchestrator Service listening on port 50055
✅ Active councils: 0
⚠️  No agents configured - councils are empty
```

## 🔄 API Evolution

### v0.1.0 (Initial)
```
3 RPCs:
- Deliberate
- Orchestrate  
- GetStatus

Problem: Designed without understanding context
```

### v0.2.0 (Current - Refactored) ⭐
```
12 RPCs organized by category:

Synchronous (3):
- Deliberate, Orchestrate, StreamDeliberation

Agent Management (4):
- RegisterAgent, CreateCouncil, ListCouncils, UnregisterAgent

Event Processing (2):
- ProcessPlanningEvent, DeriveSubtasks

Context Integration (1):
- GetTaskContext

Observability (2):
- GetStatus, GetMetrics

Improvement: Designed AFTER understanding interactions
```

## 📈 Test Results

### Integration Tests (Containerized)
```
✅ 10/10 tests passing (100%)

Platform: Podman (rootless)
Duration: 0.23s
Container startup: ~2s
Network: Isolated podman network

Tests verify:
- Service connectivity
- All 12 RPCs respond correctly
- UNIMPLEMENTED status for incomplete features
- Error handling
- Health checks
```

### Unit Tests
```
✅ 20 scenarios passing (100%)

Coverage: 100% of server methods
Mock strategy: All external dependencies mocked in tests
No mocks in production code
```

## 🔒 Security Posture

### Container
- ✅ Non-root user (appuser, UID 1000)
- ✅ No privilege escalation
- ✅ All Linux capabilities dropped
- ✅ Seccomp profile enabled
- ✅ Health checks configured

### Kubernetes
- ✅ SecurityContext (pod + container level)
- ✅ Resource limits enforced
- ✅ Service account token not mounted
- ✅ Semantic version tags (v0.2.0)
- ✅ Private ClusterIP (not exposed publicly)

### Code
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ No secrets in source
- ✅ Environment-based config
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ No generated files in git

## 🎯 Current State vs Future State

### What Works Now
```
✅ gRPC API (12 RPCs defined)
✅ GetStatus - Health checks
✅ ListCouncils - Returns council state
✅ All other RPCs - Return UNIMPLEMENTED with clear messages
✅ Container builds reproducibly
✅ Deployed and running in cluster
✅ Tests comprehensive and passing
✅ Documentation complete
```

### What Needs Implementation
```
⏳ Agent creation with LLM backends
⏳ Real deliberation logic
⏳ NATS consumer for agile.events
⏳ Context Service integration
⏳ Task derivation logic
⏳ Result persistence (Neo4j/Redis)
⏳ Streaming deliberation updates
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Process Matters
**Wrong:** API → Implementation → "Oops"  
**Right:** Context → Interactions → Use Cases → API

### 2. Honesty in Code
Servers should be honest about capabilities. Return `UNIMPLEMENTED`, don't fake it with mocks.

### 3. Build-Time Generation
APIs generated during build = cleaner repo, reproducible builds, no drift.

### 4. Testing Philosophy
- Unit tests: Use mocks
- Integration tests: Use real containers
- Production: No mocks, ever

### 5. Iteration is OK
First version had gaps. We learned, refactored, improved. That's good engineering.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# Test locally (zero dependencies)
./scripts/run-integration-tests-podman.sh

# Check cluster deployment
kubectl get pods -n swe-ai-fleet -l app=orchestrator
kubectl logs -n swe-ai-fleet -l app=orchestrator -f

# Call from another pod
kubectl run test --rm -i --image=python:3.11-slim -n swe-ai-fleet -- \
  bash -c "pip install grpcio && python -c 'import grpc; \
  channel = grpc.insecure_channel(\"orchestrator:50055\"); \
  print(\"✅ Connected\"); channel.close()'"
```

### Next Development Steps
1. Implement AgentFactory with LLM client
2. Add NATS consumer to server
3. Integrate Context Service client
4. Implement task derivation
5. Add result persistence

- Added Dockerfile
- Created tests

**Result:** Working, but incomplete understanding

### Phase 2: Testing & Hardening
- Added Testcontainers
- Podman support
- Security hardening
- Complete documentation

**Result:** Production-ready infrastructure

### Phase 3: Context Analysis ⭐

- Learned: API must come AFTER context

**Result:** Better understanding, documented gaps

### Phase 4: API Refactor ⭐
- Redesigned API based on context
- Added 9 new RPCs
- Updated tests
- Redeployed to cluster

**Result:** Context-driven API, properly scoped

### Phase 5: Production Cleanup
