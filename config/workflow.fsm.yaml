# Workflow FSM Configuration
# Defines task execution workflow with multi-role coordination and RBAC action validation
#
# Flow: Developer → Architect → QA → PO (with rejection loops)
#
# This is RBAC Level 2: Workflow Action Control
# Complementary to Planning Service FSM (story-level)

# NOTES
# ============================================================================
# This FSM is complementary to Planning Service FSM:
#
# Planning FSM (Story-level):
#   DRAFT → PO_REVIEW → READY_FOR_DEV → IN_PROGRESS → CODE_REVIEW → DONE
#
# Workflow FSM (Task-level):
#   todo → implementing → arch review → qa testing → po approval → done
#
# Integration:
#   - Planning transitions to IN_PROGRESS → triggers workflow task assignment
#   - Workflow all tasks done → Planning can transition to CODE_REVIEW → DONE
