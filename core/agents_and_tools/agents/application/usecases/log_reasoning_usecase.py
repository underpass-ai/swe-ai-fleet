    Use case for logging agent reasoning thoughts.

    This use case handles the business logic for:
    - Capturing agent's internal thoughts
    - Logging to ReasoningLogs entity
    - Providing observability for agent decision-making

    Following DDD + Hexagonal Architecture:
    - No infrastructure dependencies (pure domain logic)
    - Logs to ReasoningLogs entity (domain abstraction)
    - Can be extended to log to external systems via port
