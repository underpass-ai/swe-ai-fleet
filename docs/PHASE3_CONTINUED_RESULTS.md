## 🚀 Next Steps for Phase 4

### Target: Reach 75-80% Coverage (9-10% more needed)

**Priority 1 - Handlers & Adapters (1-2 hours)**:
1. `services/orchestrator/infrastructure/handlers` (26.5% → 70%)
   - Event handlers for agent requests/responses
   - Error handling paths
   - ~50-80 tests needed

2. `services/orchestrator/infrastructure/adapters` (54.7% → 75%)
   - Redis adapter edge cases
   - Neo4j adapter error paths
   - ~30-40 tests needed

**Priority 2 - Evaluators & Services (1 hour)**:
1. `core/evaluators/` - verify and fill gaps
2. `services/orchestrator/` - remaining modules

**Estimated Coverage After Phase 4**:
- With handlers + adapters: ~72-73%
- With evaluators + services: ~75-78%
- **80% achievable with ~100-150 more targeted tests**

## ✅ Quality Checklist

- [x] All 953 tests passing (100%)
- [x] Coverage maintained at ~70% baseline
- [x] Branch clean, no uncommitted changes
- [x] Quick wins completed (40 tests in 30 min)
- [x] High-impact modules improved (vllm_agent 58%→70%)
- [x] Conventional commit messages used
- [x] Documentation updated

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Quick wins are multiplicative**: 40 tests in 30 min vs hours of integration work
2. **Dataclass coverage is free**: Many tests for initialization with zero external dependencies
3. **High-impact modules first**: vllm_agent 58% had major uncovered paths
4. **Distribution matters**: Keeping baseline steady while improving module-level coverage
5. **Next frontier**: Infrastructure handlers (26.5%) are the biggest opportunity

---

## 📝 Remaining Work

**For Phase 4 (Next Session)**:
1. Attack `orchestrator.handlers` (26.5% → 70%)
2. Fill `orchestrator.adapters` gaps (54.7% → 75%)
3. Target 75-78% overall coverage
4. Then push final sprint to 80%+

**Branch Status**: Ready for PR merge after Phase 4 completion
**Timeline**: 1-2 more sessions to reach 80% target
