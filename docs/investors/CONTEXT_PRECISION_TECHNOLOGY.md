### Role-Specific Context Packs

#### 🧑‍💻 Developer Context (150-300 tokens)
```yaml
developer_context:
  task: "Fix authentication bug"
  failing_test: "test_auth_otp.py:47 - token validation fails"
  relevant_code: |
    # auth/otp.py:23-45 (15 lines only)
    def validate_otp(token, user_id):
        # BUG: Missing time window check
        return token == get_stored_token(user_id)
  acceptance_criteria: "User can login with OTP, lockout after 5 attempts"
  api_spec: "POST /auth/verify-otp {token: string, user_id: string}"
  related_decisions: "D-42: OTP source of truth - use Redis cache"
```

#### 🧪 QA Context (100-200 tokens)
```yaml
qa_context:
  test_scenarios: |
    1. Valid OTP within 5 minutes
    2. Invalid OTP format  
    3. Expired OTP (>5 minutes)
    4. Lockout after 5 failed attempts
  regression_tests: "test_auth_basic.py, test_auth_2fa.py"
  coverage_target: "95% for auth/otp.py"
  test_data: "test_otp_tokens.json"
```

#### 🏗️ Architect Context (200-400 tokens)
```yaml
architect_context:
  decision_needed: "OTP validation approach"
  trade_offs: |
    Redis: Fast, scalable, but adds dependency
    Database: Reliable, but slower queries
    Memory: Fastest, but not persistent
  non_functional: "Response time <100ms, 99.9% availability"
  related_decisions: "D-42: OTP source of truth"
  system_impact: "Affects auth service, user experience"
```
