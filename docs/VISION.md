# Vision — EdgeCrew

EdgeCrew is the **reference architecture** for multi-agent agile engineering.

## Mission
Create the first open-source industry reference for multi-agent agile engineering, making autonomous software squads trustworthy, auditable, and efficient.

## Differentiators
- Agile squad simulation with role-based agents.
- Human as Product Owner (no PM bot).
- Automated role-context pipelines.
- Memory hybrid: in-memory short-term + graph long-term.
- Deployment: workstation (4×24 GB GPUs) or enterprise cluster.

## Roadmap
- M1: End-to-end flow (cluster from YAML).
- M2: Knowledge graph memory & user story lifecycle.
- M3: Advanced validators and QA suite.
- M4: Enterprise-ready Helm charts, CI/CD integration.
