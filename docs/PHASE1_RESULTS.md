## 🎯 Key Findings

### ✅ Phase 1 Success Criteria - ALL MET

| Criterion | Target | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| All 36 failing tests pass | 100% | ✅ 810/810 | ✅ PASS |
| `make test-unit` succeeds | 100% | ✅ 7.46s | ✅ PASS |
| coverage.xml generated | Yes | ✅ Generated | ✅ PASS |
| Baseline coverage ≥69% | ≥69% | ✅ 69.37% | ✅ PASS |

### ✅ Protobuf Generation Works
- gRPC stubs generated automatically in `/tmp` during test execution
- Scripts `_generate_protos.sh` functioning correctly
- Cleanup successful (stubs removed after tests)
- **No import errors**: `services.*.gen` properly resolved

### ✅ No Failing Tests
Previous status (from `UNIT_TESTS_TO_FIX.md`):
- 36 total tests failing (16 ERRORS + 20 FAILED)

Current status:
- **0 tests failing** ✅
- **810 tests passing** ✅

## 🚨 Deprecation Warnings to Fix

### DateTime.utcnow() Deprecation
**Location**: `tests/unit/test_runner_tool_implementation.py:209-210`

**Issue**: `datetime.utcnow()` deprecated in Python 3.12+

**Fix**: Replace with `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)`

```python
# OLD (deprecated)
started_at = datetime.utcnow()
finished_at = datetime.utcnow()

# NEW (recommended)
from datetime import datetime, UTC
started_at = datetime.now(UTC)
finished_at = datetime.now(UTC)
```
