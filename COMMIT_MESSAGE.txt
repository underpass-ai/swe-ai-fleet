feat: Add PO-facing Planner module with complete story and plan management

Implemented a comprehensive Product Owner-facing Planner module following Clean Architecture principles.

## Features

### Domain Layer
- Story entity with FSM lifecycle (9 states)
- Plan entity with subtask management and dependencies
- AcceptanceCriteria with Gherkin/Checklist support
- Definition of Ready (DoR) validation

### Use Cases
- Story: Create, Update, Get, List
- Plan: Create, Approve, Reject, Get
- Full workflow support from story creation to plan approval

### Adapters
- Redis: Short-term persistence (30-day TTL)
- Neo4j: Long-term graph persistence
- gRPC: Planning FSM service integration (stub ready)

### CLI Interface
- `swe-ai-fleet planner story` commands
- `swe-ai-fleet planner plan` commands
- JSON and text output formats
- Filtering and pagination support

### Testing
- 48+ unit tests covering all domain models and use cases
- 100% test coverage for critical paths
- AsyncMock-based testing for async operations

### Documentation
- Complete module documentation (PLANNER_MODULE.md)
- Quick start guide (PLANNER_QUICK_START.md)
- Working examples with step-by-step workflow
- API reference and integration guides

## Architecture

```
CLI/API → Use Cases → Domain ← Ports → Adapters (Redis/Neo4j/gRPC)
```

## File Statistics

- 41 Python files
- 47 total files (including docs and examples)
- ~6700 lines of code
- Zero linter errors

## Integration Points

- Planning FSM Service (Go) via gRPC
- Redis for short-term persistence
- Neo4j for long-term graph storage
- Future: Orchestrator, Context Service, Web UI

## Next Steps

- Integration testing with real Redis/Neo4j
- gRPC client implementation for Planning service
- React-based PO dashboard
- Real-time progress notifications
