# SWE AI Fleet - Detailed Roadmap

## üéØ Project Vision

Build a fleet of LLM agents specialized in software engineering that simulates a real human team (developers, devops, QA, architect, data engineer). The agents work in a coordinated manner, with atomic context per use case, and with the human as Product Owner (PO) who supervises and approves.

**Key differentiators:**
- **Complete traceability** of decisions and executions
- **Intelligent persistence** in Redis (short term) and Neo4j (long term/graph)
- **Guaranteed minimal context** for each role and subtask
- **Simulation of real software engineering processes**
- **Tool execution** with sandboxing and complete audit

## üöÄ Current Status (M0-M1 Completed)

### ‚úÖ Basic Infrastructure
- [x] CRI‚ÄëO manifests for Redis + Neo4j
- [x] Unified Makefile for orchestration
- [x] E2E smoke test validated (kg_smoke.py ‚Üí neo4j_writer)
- [x] Initial CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- [x] Helm charts for Kubernetes

### ‚úÖ Memory System
- [x] `RedisStoreImpl` for LLM calls/responses
- [x] TTL + Streams for ephemeral persistence
- [x] `Neo4jDecisionGraphAdapter` with DTOs and constraints
- [x] Partial Redis ‚Üí Neo4j synchronization

### ‚úÖ Intelligent Context
- [x] Atomic context per use case
- [x] `PromptScopePolicy`: information filtering by role
- [x] `ContextAssembler`: packaging for each agent
- [x] Scope matrix by role and phase (configurable YAML)

### ‚úÖ Implemented Use Cases
- [x] Save LLM calls and responses (Redis)
- [x] Generate technical report for a use case

- **Tool security**: Strict sandboxing and complete audit
- **Performance**: Continuous monitoring and incremental optimizations

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep**: Maintain focus on M4 (tools) as priority
- **External dependencies**: Contingency plan for LLMs and tools
- **Community**: Start early engagement in M3-M4

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete M2** (Context and Minimization)
2. **Start M4** (Tool Execution) - **CRITICAL**
3. **Prepare architecture** for M3 (Agents and Roles)
4. **Validate existing use cases**
5. **Optimize Neo4j queries**

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Critical Priority: M4 (Tools)
The jump from M3 to M4 is fundamental because it transforms the system from "talk and reason" to "execute, validate and learn" autonomously, closing the complete cycle of real software engineering.

### Integration with Existing Tools
- **kubectl_tool.py**: Base for infrastructure tools
- **helm_tool.py**: Helm integration
- **psql_tool.py**: Database tools
- **validators.py**: Tool validation

### Extensibility
The system is designed to be extensible:
- New roles through YAML configuration
- New tools through the tool system
- New memory types through adapters
- New use cases through the orchestrator
