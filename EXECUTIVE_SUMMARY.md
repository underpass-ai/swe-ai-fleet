# SWE AI Fleet - Executive Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Status

**SWE AI Fleet** is an open-source multi-agent system that simulates a real software development team. The project has successfully completed milestones M0-M1 and is in progress with M2.

### âœ… Completed (M0-M1)
- **Basic infrastructure**: Docker Compose, Redis, Neo4j, Helm charts
- **Memory system**: Redis with Streams and TTL, Neo4j for decision graph
- **Intelligent context**: Context assembler with role-based scope policies
- **Basic use cases**: LLM event persistence, session rehydration

### ðŸš§ In Progress (M2-M4)
- **Context optimization**: Automatic compression of long sessions
- **Advanced redactor**: For secrets and sensitive data
- **Context dashboard**: Basic UI for monitoring
- **Runner Contract**: Standardized agent-container interaction protocol
- **Containerized Execution**: Multi-runtime task execution system

## ðŸš€ Current Milestone: M4 - Tool Execution (Partially Complete)

### Progress Update

**M4 (Tool Execution)** represents the most important qualitative leap of the project:

- **Before**: System that "talks and reasons" about code
- **After**: System that "executes, validates and learns" autonomously

### âœ… Completed Components

1. **Runner Contract Protocol**: Standardized TaskSpec/TaskResult for agent-container interaction
2. **Containerized Execution**: Multi-runtime support (Podman/Docker/Kubernetes)
3. **agent-task Shim**: Standardized task execution interface with language support
4. **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol support for seamless agent communication
5. **Security Features**: Non-root execution, resource limits, and audit trails
6. **Context Integration**: Redis/Neo4j integration for complete traceability

### ðŸš§ Remaining Work

This change closes the complete cycle of real software engineering, allowing agents to:
1. **Implement** code and configurations âœ…
2. **Execute** tests and validations âœ…
3. **Analyze** results and metrics ðŸš§
4. **Iterate** based on real feedback ðŸš§

### Tool Gateway Architecture

```
Agent LLM â†’ Tool Gateway (FastAPI) â†’ Policy Engine â†’ Sandbox Executor â†’ Audit Log
     â†“
Redis Streams â†’ Neo4j (complete traceability)
```

### Key Components

1. **Tool Gateway**: REST API with FastAPI for execution requests
2. **Policy Engine**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **Sandbox Executor**: Isolated execution in Docker containers
4. **Audit Logger**: Complete traceability of all operations

### Security and Isolation

- **Ephemeral rootless containers** for each execution
- **No network access** by default
- **Strict limits** on CPU, memory and processes
- **Role-based allowlists** for allowed commands
- **Complete audit** of each operation

## ðŸ“Š Impact and Benefits

### For the Project
- **Key differentiation** from ChatDev/SWE-Agent
- **Realistic simulation** of development teams
- **Complete traceability** of decisions and executions
- **Solid foundation** for M5 (E2E Flow) and M6 (Community)

### For the Community
- **Open source** with scalable architecture
- **Integration** with real development tools
- **Documentation** and use case examples
- **Extensibility** for new roles and tools

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- Basic Tool Gateway with FastAPI
- Policy Engine with basic validations
- Sandbox Executor with Docker
- Basic Audit Logger

### Phase 2: Security & Isolation (Week 3)

- Advanced structured logging
- Performance tuning and optimizations
- Kubernetes deployment

## ðŸ”§ Technical Resources

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.13+, FastAPI, Redis, Neo4j
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose (local), Kubernetes + Ray/KubeRay (production)
- **Testing**: pytest, e2e tests, security tests
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

### Component Architecture
```
UI/PO â†’ Orchestrator â†’ Context Assembler â†’ Agents â†’ Tools â†’ Memory (Redis + Neo4j)
```

### Design Patterns
- **Clean Architecture** with ports/adapters
- **Event Sourcing** with Redis Streams
- **CQRS** for complex queries
- **Policy-based** for access control
- **Sandbox pattern** for secure execution

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics

### Technical
- **Response time** < 2s for context queries
- **Context compression** > 60% for long sessions
- **Test coverage** > 90%
- **Traceability** 100% of decisions and executions

### Functional
- **Complete use cases** implemented and working
- **Integration with real development tools**
- **Coordinated and efficient multi-agent system**
- **Clear and complete documentation**

## ðŸš¨ Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **Neo4j graph complexity**: Implement optimized queries and cache
- **Tool security**: Strict sandboxing and complete audit
- **Performance**: Continuous monitoring and incremental optimizations

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep**: Maintain focus on M4 (tools) as priority
- **External dependencies**: Contingency plan for LLMs and tools
- **Community**: Start early engagement in M3-M4

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Start implementation** of basic Tool Gateway
2. **Set up development environment** for tools
3. **Define security policies** by role
4. **Plan security and isolation tests**

### Short Term (Next 2-3 Weeks)
1. **Complete M2** (Context and Minimization)
2. **Implement M4** (Tool Gateway) in parallel
3. **Validate existing use cases**
4. **Optimize Neo4j queries**

### Medium Term (1-2 Months)
1. **Complete M4** (Tool Gateway)
2. **Start M3** (Agents and Roles)
3. **Prepare M5** (E2E Flow)
4. **Early community engagement**

## ðŸš€ Conclusion

**SWE AI Fleet** is at a critical inflection point. With the basic infrastructure (M0-M1) completed and the intelligent context system (M2) in progress, the next natural and critical step is to implement the **Tool Gateway (M4)**.

This milestone will fundamentally transform the system's capabilities, allowing agents to not only reason about code, but to execute, validate and learn autonomously. It is the foundation for achieving realistic simulation of a software development team.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize the implementation of M4 (Tool Gateway) as the next critical milestone, as it is the key differentiator that will position the project as a leader in its category.
