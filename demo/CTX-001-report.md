# Implementation Report (Graph-guided) — Build minimal context demo

- **Case ID:** `CTX-001`
- **Plan ID:** `P-CTX-001`  |  **Status:** `DRAFT`  |  **Version:** `1`
- **Generated at:** `2025-09-11 18:25:41`

## Overview
Seed Redis and Neo4j with a tiny example for the context bounded context.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Redis contains case spec and plan draft
2. Neo4j contains decisions and relations

## Decisions (ordered)
| ID | Title | Status | Author | Created At |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `D1` | Use Redis for planning state | `PROPOSED` | `actor:planner` | - |
| `D2` | Use Neo4j for decision graph | `PROPOSED` | `actor:planner` | - |

## Decision Dependency Map
- `D1`: `DEPENDS_ON` → `D2`

## Decision → Subtask Impact
_No subtask influenced by decisions._

## Subtasks (from planning draft)
| ID | Title | Role | Depends On | Est. Points | Priority | Risk | Tech |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `S1` | Design Redis keys | `architect` | - | 1.0 | 1 | 0.00 | redis |
| `S2` | Model decisions in Neo4j | `developer` | S1 | 2.0 | 2 | 0.00 | neo4j |

## Milestones & Timeline (PO-led)
- `2025-09-11 17:48:18` — **Case created** by `agent:planner`
- `2025-09-11 17:57:51` — **Case created** by `agent:planner`
- `2025-09-11 18:02:59` — **Case created** by `agent:planner`
- `2025-09-11 18:06:35` — **Case created** by `agent:planner`
- `2025-09-11 18:12:18` — **Case created** by `agent:planner`
- **Current plan status:** `DRAFT` (v1)

## Next Steps
- Validate decision dependencies vs. implementation order.
- Ensure observability and security decisions are reflected in CI/CD.
- Reconcile plan status with PO priorities and delivery timeline.
