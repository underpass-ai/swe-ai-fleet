"""Application layer for orchestrator service.

This layer contains use cases that orchestrate domain logic
and coordinate between domain entities and ports.

Following Clean Architecture:
- Use cases define application-specific business rules
- Use cases depend on domain (entities, ports)
- Use cases are independent of infrastructure (use ports, not adapters)
